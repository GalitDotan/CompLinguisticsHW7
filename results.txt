the first professor i saw, was in a very large room, with forty pupils
about him.  after salutation, observing me to look earnestly upon a
frame, which took up the greatest part of both the length and breadth of
the room, he said, 'perhaps i might wonder to see him employed in a
project for improving speculative knowledge, by practical and mechanical
operations.  but the world would soon be sensible of its usefulness and
he flattered himself, that a more noble, exalted thought never sprang in
any other man?s head.  every one knew how laborious the usual method is
of attaining to arts and sciences whereas, by his contrivance, the most
ignorant person, at a reasonable charge, and with a little bodily labour,
might write books in philosophy, poetry, politics, laws, mathematics, and
theology, without the least assistance from genius or study.'  he then
led me to the frame, about the sides, whereof all his pupils stood in
ranks.  it was twenty feet square, placed in the middle of the room.  the
superfices was composed of several bits of wood, about the bigness of a
die, but some larger than others.  they were all linked together by
slender wires.  these bits of wood were covered, on every square, with
paper pasted on them and on these papers were written all the words of
their language, in their several moods, tenses, and declensions but
without any order.  the professor then desired me 'to observe for he was
going to set his engine at work.'  the pupils, at his command, took each
of them hold of an iron handle, whereof there were forty fixed round the
edges of the frame and giving them a sudden turn, the whole disposition
of the words was entirely changed.  he then commanded sixandthirty of
the lads, to read the several lines softly, as they appeared upon the
frame and where they found three or four words together that might make
part of a sentence, they dictated to the four remaining boys, who were
scribes.  this work was repeated three or four times, and at every turn,
the engine was so contrived, that the words shifted into new places, as
the square bits of wood moved upside down.
